/*

When you update a node's distance, you add it to the queue.
If later you find a better path, you add it again.
The PriorityQueue may have many copies of the same node (with old distances).

Even after you process a node once (and you think you‚Äôre "done" with it), later you might discover a better path to that node from some other vertex.
This is why ‚Äî if you're not using visited[] ‚Äî you might insert the same node again into the PriorityQueue.

‚úÖ Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm:
Works on:
Cyclic graphs
Acyclic (DAG) graphs
Directed and undirected graphs
Graphs with non-negative edge weights
‚ùå Does not work with:
Negative edge weights ‚Üí because it assumes once a node is visited with the shortest path, it doesn't need to be updated again ‚Äî which fails when negative weights exist.
 */




 /*
  *  If you directly use edge list for algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra:
Every time you visit a node and want to process its neighbors:

You have to loop over all edges and check:
So for every recursive call (DFS, Dijkstra, etc.), you end up scanning the full edge list.

This makes your neighbor lookup O(E) for each node.

/*
 üí° Dijkstra's Algorithm ‚Äî The Rule
At every step, always pick the unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the start node.
Then, update its neighbors' distances if you found a shorter path to them.

üî¨ Formal steps of Dijkstra:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Start:

Set the distance of start node = 0.
Set the distance of all other nodes = ‚àû (infinity).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Put all nodes into an unvisited set.

3Ô∏è‚É£ While unvisited nodes remain:

Select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance.

Mark it as visited.

For each neighbor of that node:
If going through this node gives a shorter distance to the neighbor ‚Üí update it.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat until all nodes are visited (or until you reached your target).

üö© The core idea:
Always explore the most promising node first (smallest distance so far).

üî• Key concept:
Dijkstra always assumes:

"If I already visited a node with the smallest possible distance, I don't need to revisit it again."
This is only true if you always process the smallest distance node first.
That‚Äôs why you need a priority queue (or something similar) to guarantee this.

‚ö† If you don't follow that rule:
Dijkstra's assumption breaks.

You may lock in a wrong distance too early.

You get wrong answers.
 */



/*
 *  What Dijkstra's Algorithm Is Designed For:
Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm is specifically designed to avoid updating visited nodes.

üîÅ It works like this:
Start from the source node.
Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
Once you pop a node from the queue and mark it as visited:
You are guaranteeing: "This is the shortest path to this node."
You never need to update this node again, because no future path will be shorter.


Dijkstra‚Äôs Flow (Simplified)
Start with a source node. Set its distance to 0, all others to ‚àû.

Push the source into a min-priority queue (PQ), sorted by shortest distance.
While the queue is not empty:
Pop the node with the smallest current distance ‚Üí cur
If curr is already visited, skip (to avoid unnecessary work)
Mark curr as visited
Loop over all neighbors of curr:
For each neighbor next:
If dist[curr] + edgeWeight < dist[next]:
Update dist[next]
Push next into the queue with updated distance
