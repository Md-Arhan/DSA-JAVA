/*
INTUTION
The key question it keeps asking

For nodes i → j:

Is going directly from i to j better,
or going i → k → j?

So the recurrence is:
dist[i][j]=min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k]+dist[k][j])
Intuition using “permission” idea 🪪

Imagine nodes as cities.

Initially:
You’re not allowed to stop anywhere in between.
dist[i][j] = direct road cost.

Step by step:

Allow node 0 as a stop

Then allow node 1

Then 2, 3, …

At step k, paths are allowed to use only nodes {0..k} as intermediates.

/*
 * Each loop runs 𝑛 times.
The innermost operation is a constant time comparison and assignment.
So overall complexity is 𝑛×𝑛×𝑛=𝑂(𝑛3)n×n×n=O(n3)

Extra Notes:
Space complexity: 𝑂(𝑛2) for the dist matrix.
 */


/*
 * If:

dist[i][j] is the current known shortest path from i to j
dist[i][k] is the shortest path from i to k
dist[k][j] is the shortest path from k to j

 What does dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] mean?
It means:so it is telling go to [i][k] means if we are at 2 go to 1 and check there is there any possibilty to go for 3 from there

"If I'm at node i, can I go to node j via an intermediate node k, and is that route shorter than what I already know?"
Or simplified
"From i, go to k, then from k, go to j. If this is shorter than my current path from i to j, update it."
