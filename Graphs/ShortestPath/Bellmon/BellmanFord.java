/*
 * Bellman-Ford guarantees this:

After exactly V-1 iterations, all shortest paths from the source are correctly calculated â€” even if some paths are very long (up to V-1 edges).

ðŸ”¥ Key point:
Sometimes you get the correct answer even earlier â€” maybe after 1 or 2 iterations.
But Bellman-Ford doesnâ€™t know in advance how many edges any shortest path will require.
So to guarantee correctness for all possible graphs, it always performs V-1 full passes.
âœ… Bellman-Ford idea in one sentence:
"Keep relaxing all edges V-1 times â€” if any better path exists, Iâ€™ll eventually find it."

 */




/*
 * ðŸŸ¢ What is Bellman-Ford?
Bellman-Ford is a single-source shortest path algorithm â€” like Dijkstra â€” but works even if there are negative weight edges (as long as there's no negative weight cycle).

ðŸŸ¢ Where Bellman-Ford is used?
âœ… When you have:
negative edge weights
you want to detect negative weight cycles
graph can be directed or undirected
works on both adjacency list or edge list
ðŸŸ¢ Algorithm Idea
You start from a source node src.

Distance to all nodes: dis[]
Initialize: dis[src] = 0, others = âˆž
Then, for V-1 times (V = total vertices):
You go through all edges (u â†’ v with weight wt).
Apply relaxation:
if dis[u] + wt < dis[v]:
    dis[v] = dis[u] + wt
ðŸŸ¢ Why V-1 times?
ðŸ‘‰ Because in the worst case, the shortest path might have V-1 edges (like a chain through all vertices).
For example:
S â†’ A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D

Shortest path from S to D is 4 edges (V-1 = 5-1 = 4)
Each iteration may only relax one level deeper, so you need V-1 iterations to ensure every possible chain is updated fully.

ðŸŸ¢ After V-1 iterations?
Do one extra pass:

If any edge can still relax, then â†’ Negative Weight Cycle exists.

for each edge (u, v, wt):
    if dis[u] + wt < dis[v]:
        -> negative cycle exists
ðŸŸ¢ Time Complexity
O(V Ã— E)
 */


 

/*
 * ðŸ”‘ Core formula:
Bellman-Ford needs V-1 iterations because any shortest path in a graph with V nodes can have at most V-1 edges.

ðŸ”¥ Why?
In a simple path, you cannot visit more than V-1 edges, otherwise you revisit some node (cycle).
So any shortest path has at most V-1 edges.
Therefore, you need to relax all edges up to V-1 times to ensure even the farthest node from the source gets updated correctly.

 /*
  *  Because you donâ€™t process nodes in order (like Dijkstra), you need multiple full edge passes to "propagate" shortest distances outward step-by-step.

  | Algorithm        | Needs Sorted Priority? | Reason                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dijkstra**     | YES                    | Uses priority queue â€” always processes smallest distance node first (greedy). |
| **Bellman-Ford** | NO                     | Simply brute-force relaxes all edges again and again.                         |

//Perfect example

/*
 *  You said:
why it's again and again
because we donâ€™t know which u has v and which v has u

Exactly. Thatâ€™s 100% the point.

We don't know in advance:
Which edge should come first
Which node is depending on which
Which v can only be relaxed after its parent u was relaxed

ðŸ”§ Letâ€™s visualize:
Imagine edges randomly ordered like:

From	To	Weight
B	C	4
A	B	3
S	A	2

Even though logically S â†’ A â†’ B â†’ C

The edges might be checked in any random order.

ðŸ”„ Why we need multiple full passes:
Iteration	What happens
1	You might relax S â†’ A (A gets distance 2)
1	Then you might check B â†’ C, but B still âˆž â†’ can't update C
1	Then you check A â†’ B â†’ now B gets updated (to 5)
1	But too late for B â†’ C in this pass
2	Now B has valid distance, so you relax B â†’ C
3	If needed, more passes keep checking

ðŸ”‘ In short:
We donâ€™t know the right processing sequence of nodes upfront
â†’ so we keep looping all edges again and again
â†’ until every possible update has "propagated" properly.
 */


/*
 * âœ… Advantages of Adjacency List:
Less memory (better for sparse graphs)

Slightly faster inner loop: you donâ€™t need to scan all nodes to find edges â€” neighbors are directly available.

âœ… Bellman-Ford still needs V-1 passes even if we use adjacency list because:
The issue is not "how" you access edges

The issue is: "how far" updates can travel through the graph (max V-1 edges away from source).
