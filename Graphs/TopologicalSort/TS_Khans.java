/*
 * Why BFS is More Complex
üîπ 1. ‚ùó No Recursion Stack in BFS
BFS uses a queue, not recursion.

There‚Äôs no built-in "memory" of the path you're currently on.

So BFS can't detect back edges easily in directed graphs ‚Äî it just sees nodes level by level.

In DFS, you can easily say:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this node and I‚Äôm still processing it ‚Üí cycle!‚Äù
But in BFS, once you dequeue a node, it‚Äôs considered processed.

üîπ 2. You Need Extra Structures to Simulate Path Tracking
To detect cycles in directed BFS, you would need:

A visited[] array

An in-degree array or custom path-tracking logic

Often you simulate Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (topological sort) to detect cycles

So the logic becomes:

Track in-degrees

Keep removing nodes with in-degree 0

If not all nodes are processed, a cycle exists

üìå This is not intuitive like DFS.

üîπ 3. BFS is OK for Undirected Graphs (but Still Needs Parent Tracking)
Even in undirected graphs:

BFS needs to track parent nodes to avoid false cycle detection.

Why?
Because you‚Äôll revisit the parent node during traversal, and you need to ignore that case.

if (visited[neighbor] && neighbor != parent[node]) {
    // Found a cycle
}
Again, extra logic is required.

/*
 * Steps of kahan's Algorithm : 

 Fact : A DAG has at least one indegree u as 0 or least one degree v is 0, if not cycle exist

 * Steps of Kahn's Algorithm:
Calculate indegree of all vertices.

Push all vertices with indegree 0 into a queue.

While the queue is not empty:

Remove a node u from the queue and add it to the result.

For all neighbors v of u, decrease v's indegree by 1.

If v's indegree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

If all nodes are processed, return the topological order.

If not, the graph contains a cycle, so topological sort is not possible.
