/*Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in non-descending order, return the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time. */

/*If the array is sorted ascending,
Pick a number h.
From index n-h to the last index n-1 (thatâ€™s h papers total),
all of those papers must have at least h citations. */
