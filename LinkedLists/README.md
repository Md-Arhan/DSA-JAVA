 # linked List

Exactly! You nailed it.

When you iterate over a Java LinkedList, the iterator internally follows the next pointers of the linked nodes behind the scenes — you just don’t see that part because Java hides it from you.

In simple terms:
The iterator object keeps track of the current node.

Each call to next() on the iterator returns the current node’s data and moves the pointer to current.next.

So, the iteration is basically a controlled traversal of the linked list via those next pointers.
