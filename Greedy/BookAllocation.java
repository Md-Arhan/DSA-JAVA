/*

 * 🔁 Binary Search Steps:
✅ Try mid = (90 + 203) / 2 = 146
Check if we can allocate books with max 146 pages per student.  

Student 1:

12 → total = 12

+34 → total = 46

+67 → total = 113

+90 → exceeds 146 → ❌ start Student 2
Student 2:

90 → total = 90 ✅
✔ Students used: 2 (OK)

➡ canAllocateBooks = true, update result = 146, and search left: right = 145

✅ Try mid = (90 + 145) / 2 = 117
Student 1:

12 → 12

+34 → 46

+67 → 113

+90 → too much → new student

Student 2:

90 → total = 90 ✅
✔ Students used: 2 → OK

➡ canAllocateBooks = true, update result = 117, search left: right = 116

✅ Try mid = (90 + 116) / 2 = 103
Student 1:

12 → 12

+34 → 46

+67 → too much → Student 2

Student 2:

67 → 67

+90 → too much → ❌ new student (3 students needed)

✖ More than 2 students → not allowed
➡ canAllocateBooks = false, search right: left = 104

✅ Try mid = (104 + 116) / 2 = 110
Same process — we end up needing 3 students again.

➡ canAllocateBooks = false, left = 111

✅ Try mid = 113
Student 1: 12 + 34 = 46, +67 = 113 ✅
Student 2: 90 ✅
✔ 2 students → OK

➡ canAllocateBooks = true, result = 113, right = 112

✅ Try mid = 111, mid = 112
Still require 3 students → Not OK

✅ Final Result:
After binary search ends, we find the minimum possible max pages per student is 113.

//Recognization for Binary Search on answer

 /*
  * Signs It's a "Binary Search on Answer" Question
1. You’re asked to minimize or maximize something.
Example:

"Minimize the maximum..."

"Find the least number such that..."

"Max number of people that can be seated..."

"Maximum minimum distance..."

➡ These hint at a range of possible answers.

2. The answer lies in a continuous range, not a specific element.
You’re not searching in the array,

You’re searching over a range of numeric values (like 1 to 10⁹).

3. You can write a helper function to check if a solution is valid.
This is the key 🔑

You can define:

java
Copy
Edit
boolean isValid(int mid)
to test whether a certain value satisfies the condition.
