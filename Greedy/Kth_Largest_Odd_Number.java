/*
 * Dry Run Example 1:
1. int start = (L % 2 == 0) ? L + 1 : L;
Meaning:

If L is even (L % 2 == 0), it moves to the next odd number by adding 1.

If L is already odd, keep it as it is.

Why?
Because we are only interested in odd numbers. We adjust L to make sure start points to the first odd number â‰¥ L.

2. int end = (R % 2 == 0) ? R - 1 : R;
Meaning:

If R is even, move back by 1 to reach the last odd number â‰¤ R.

If R is already odd, keep it.

Why?
Same reason â€” we need to focus only on odd numbers. So adjust end to the last odd number â‰¤ R.

3. if (start > end) return 0;
Meaning:

After adjusting, if start has crossed end, that means no odd numbers exist in [L, R].

Why?
Imagine L = 6 and R = 6.

L is even, so start = 7.

R is even, so end = 5.

start > end â†’ no odds exist between 6 and 6 â†’ return 0.

4. int count = (end - start) / 2 + 1;
Meaning:

Count the total number of odd numbers between start and end.

Odd numbers are spaced 2 apart (like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...).

Why formula?

(end - start) / 2 gives how many jumps of 2 you can make.

+1 is because both start and end are inclusive.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
start = 1, end = 9 â†’ (9 - 1) / 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 odds (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

5. if (K > count) return 0;
Meaning:

If K is larger than the total number of odd numbers, then it's impossible to find the K-th largest odd number.

Why?
Simple â€” you can't find the 6th largest odd number if only 3 odd numbers exist.

6. return end - 2 * (K - 1);
Meaning:

Start from the largest odd (end).

Each previous odd number is 2 less.

So move back by 2 * (K - 1) to reach the K-th largest.

Why?
Each odd number is separated by 2.

1st largest â†’ end

2nd largest â†’ end - 2

3rd largest â†’ end - 4

...

Thus, formula: end - 2 * (K - 1)


(end - start) / 2 â†’ counts the gaps between odd numbers.

+1 â†’ includes the starting odd number itself.
