/*Explanation:

1. Base Case: If there's only one disk, move it directly from source to destination.


2. Recursive Case:

Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary.

Move the nth disk from source to destination.

Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination.




Sample Output for 3 Disks:

Solution for 3 disks:
Move disk 1 from A to C
Move disk 2 from A to B
Move disk 1 from C to B
Move disk 3 from A to C
Move disk 1 from B to A
Move disk 2 from B to C
Move disk 1 from A to C
